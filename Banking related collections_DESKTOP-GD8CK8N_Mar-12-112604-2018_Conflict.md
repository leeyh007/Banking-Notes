- IMF
- Charles W. Calomiris & Stephen H. Haber, *Fragile by Design: The Political Origins of Banking Crises and Scarce Credit*
	- they try to explain the political roots of differences in banking system performance across countries and over time.
	- they argue that bank's strengths and short-comings are the predictable consequences of **political bargains** and that those bargains are structured by a country's **fundamental political institutions.**
	- bank is an **institutional embodiment** -- a mirror of the political system that is a product of a society's deep history.
		- why are some societies able to **construct banking systems that avoid banking crisiss**, while others are not? 
		- why some societies **limit the right to charter a bank to a favored few**, even though doing so limits the availability of credit to broad swaths of the population?
		- why do societies sometimes fail to protect the property rights of lenders, depositors, and bank stockholders in ways that undermine the ability of banks to raise funds or lend them?
