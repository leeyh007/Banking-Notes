Risk shifting problem

\begin_layout Standard
The challenge of bank corporate governance is that they must balance the
 demands of being value-maximizing entities with serving the public interest
 (Mehran and Mooineaux, 2012; Mehran et al.
 2011).
 High leverage combined with subsidized deposit insurance, goverment guarantees
 and bank opacity creates motives and opportunities for risk-taking which
 can be optimal from the shareholders' point of view given limited liability,
 but not form an economy-wide point of view if such risk-taking increases
 the probability of failure that raises systemic risk.

\begin_layout Standard
Banks may also have incentives to suppress public information about their
 assets to support their role as liquidity providers (Gorton, 2013; Dang
 et al., 2014).
 This opaque lead to excessive-risk taking by individual banks and the contribut

 To the extent that the balance sheets of many banks are simultaneously

Transparency and Discipline of Bank risk-taking
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The thrust of much of this research is to examine whether the prices of
 banks’ securities respond to changes in bank risk in a timely fashion (e.g.,
 Flannery and Nikolova, 2004).
 Acharya et al.
 (2014) show that while a positive relationship exists between risk and
 credit spreads for medium and small institutions, the risk-to-spread relationsh
ip is significantly weaker for the largest institutions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Berger and Turk-Ariss (2014) test whether discipline exerted by depositors
 decreased or increased during the crisis.
 They find that significant depositor discipline existed prior to the crisis
 in both the U.S.
 and EU, but that that such discipline generally decreased during the crisis,
 consistent with government reactions dampening market discipline (e.g., expanding
 deposit insurance coverage and rescuing troubled institutions).

 These include increased incentives for risk-shifting activities (Bushman

Volcker Rule and proprietary trading
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Debates of the Volcker Rule
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 Duffie (2012) argues that there will be two main unintended consequences
 :
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The rule would reduce the quality and capacity of market making services
 that banks provide to U.S.
 investors.
 Investors and issuers of securities would find it more costly to borrow,
 raise capital, invest, hedge risk, and obtain liquidity for their existing
 positions.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Market-making is inherently a form of proprietary trading.
 To manage the inventory risk and efficientyly provide liquidity, a market
 maker relies heavily on the option to buy and sell from other market makers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Althoug the rule allow market making, the criteria and metrics that are
 proposed would nevertheless substantially discourage the use of market
 making discretion.
 Due to the risk of regulatory sanction, career concern, and the proposed
 approach to compensation, banks' risk tolerance are reduced and their incentive
 to provide market making services are dampened.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The proposed rule would hamper efficient price discovery, lowing the quality
 of information about economic fundamentals that is revealed by markets.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Eventually, non-bank providers of market-making services would fill some
 or all of the lost market-making capacity, but with an unpredictable and
 potentially adverse impact on the safety and soundness of the financial
 system.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Non-bank broker-dealers are not regulated as banks.
 Basel III liquid capital requirements also do not apply to non-bank broker
 dealers.
 The failure or sudden loss of capacity of a large broker dealer is at least
 as adverse for the economy as the failure of a similarly large financial
 institutions devoted to conventional lending and deposit taking.
 The proposed rule could inadvertently increase systemic risk because of
 a migration of market making activities to outside of the regulated banking
 sectors.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Duffie (2012) suggests that regulatory capital and liquidity requirements
 for market making are a more cost effective method of treating the associated
 systemic risks.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 Volcker rule fail to take the evolving financial market into consideration.
 It reintroduces the static segregation of traditional banking and investment
 bank activities in Glass-Stegeal act.
 (Charles K.
 Whitehead, Volcker rule and the evolving fianncial market, 2015.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Even if proprietary trading is no longer located in banks, it may now be
 conducted by less-regulated entities that affect banks and banking activities.
 Banks that rely on hedge funds to manage credit risk will continue to be
 exposed to proprietary trading--- perhaps less directly, but now also with
 less regulatory oversight, than before.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The development of the capital market allow banks to transfer in-house managemen
t of risk to lower cost of institutes like hedge funds, which are subject
 to less regualtion, using instruments like CDS.
 (outsourcing of risk management).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
This outsourcing of credit risk management expose banks to risk of proprietary
 trading even if it happens outside the banking system.
 The problem of the outsourcing of credit risk management, like CDS, is
 that it creates empty creditor problem.
 Nobody actually implement the monitoring role.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The fluctuation of the hedge fund industry also affect banks' ability to
 extend loan because banks' ability to manage credit risk relies on hedge
 fund.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The rule leaves open the banks' ability to continue to pursue substantially
 riskier activities--- including, for example, the extension of subprime
 real estate loans.
 The rule also fails to cover longer-term commitments, which were reported
 to have been a significant source of bank losses---perhaps more significantly
 than losses from short-term trading.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3.
 Economic consequence of the Volcker Rule (Thakor, 2012)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the Volcker rule will have a negative effect on market making and liquidity
 provisions for many securities.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the rule will reduce the network benefits of market making for financial
 institutions and businesses.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the rule is likely to lead to higher cost of capital for businesses and
 petentially lower capital investments by these borrowers, along with a
 possibily greater focus on riskier or more short-term oriented investment.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
the rule will make bank risk management less efficient and will more broadly
 adversely impact the structure of financial institutions, harming the ability
 of businesses to raise capital.

 - Evidence from the Volcker Rule.
 SSRN Scholarly Paper, Social Science Research Network, Rochester, NY.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Motivated by several banks' self-declared compliance, they analyze the Volcker
 Rule’s announcement effects (or early compliance effect) on U.S.
 Bank Holding Companies.
 In line with the rule and the banks’ public compliance announcements, we
 find that those banks that are presumably most affected by the Volcker
 Rule already reduced their trading books relative to their total assets
 almost 3% more than other banks.
 However, the announcement of the rule did not reduce overall risk-taking.
 To keep their risk targets, the affected banks use the remaining trading
 assets in speculation, not in the hedging of the banking business.

 “How does bank trading activity affect performance? An investigation before
 and after the financial crisis.” Working paper, available at https://www.fdic.gov/
bank/analytical/cfr/king.pdf.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The current debate on the impact of proposed rules to ban or limit proprietary
 trading activities (e.g.
 Volcker Rule, Vickers and Liikanen reports) has motivated us to examine
 whether the exposure of U.S.
 bank holding companies (BHCs) to trading assets has an adverse impact on
 their risk, profitability and stock return.
 The literature provides conflicting evidence on how diversifying into different
 business lines may affect a BHC’s performance.
 We examine 
\series bold
three measures of a BHC’s trading activity: 
\series default
the share of trading revenues in operating income, the share of trading
 assets in total assets, and the market share of trading assets across all
 BHCs.
 We find that a BHC’s trading activities are 
\series bold
positively correlated with its riskiness 
\series default
and 
\series bold
negatively correlated with profitability and stock returns
\series default
 during and after the 2007-2009 crisis.
 These results hold when we control for changes in traditional lending activitie
s and off-balance-sheet activities.
 Additionally, we find that B
\series bold
HCs with a higher market share of trading assets make a greater contribution
 to systemic risk.

\series default
 These results suggest that limiting proprietary trading may improve BHC
 performance while reducing systemic risk, especially during economic downturns.

Bank and private equity

Fang, Lily H., Victoria Ivashina, and Josh Lerner, 2012, Combining Banking
 with Private Equity Investing.
 SSRN Scholarly Paper, Social Science Research Network, Rochester, NY.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bank-affiliated private equity (PE) groups account for 30% of all PE investments.
 These affiliated groups’ market share is highest during peaks of the PE
 market, as is the fraction of transactions where the parent bank leads
 the loan syndicate (parent-financed deals).
 Bank-affiliated deals are similar in characteristics and financing to stand-alo
ne deals, but have worse outcomes if consummated during the peaks of the
 credit market.
 Parent-financed deals enjoy significantly better financing terms than standalon
e deals, but do not exhibit better performance.
 The parent-financing advantage in loan terms is concentrated during credit
 market peaks when banks tend to syndicate more of the loans to external
 loan investors, and is not explained by the banks’ previous relationships
 with the targets, the PE groups’ reputations, or the banks’ prominence
 in structured financing markets.
 Banks’ involvement in private equity investments provides significant cross-sel
ling opportunities.
 Collectively, this evidence is consistent with banks’ taking advantage
 of favorable credit-market conditions.

regulators may practice forbearance by choosing not to intervene and close

 The literature posits a number of reasons that regulators may practice
 forbearance.
 These include political pressure (Mishkin 2000; Brown and Dinç 2005), loss
 of reputation (Boot and Thakor 1993; Mishkin 2000), or concerns that intervenin

Systemic Risk
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Following the recent financial crisis there has been considerable interest
 in modeling and measuring systemic risk.
 There is no agreed upon approach to this measurement (e.g., Bisias et al.,
 2012; Hansen, 2014).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One important stream of literature exploits the high frequency observability
 of banks’ equity prices to extract measures of systemic risk.
 Some papers in this stream use contingent claims analysis (e.g., Gray et
 al.
 2008 and Gray and Jobst, 2009), while others focus on codependence in the
 tails of equity returns using reduced form approaches (Acharya et al., 2010,
