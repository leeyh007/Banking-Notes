# Bank regulation

Myerson (2013)
> Abstract: In an important new book, Admati and Hellwig raise broad critical questions about bank regulation. These questions are reviewed and discussed here with **a focus on how the problems of maintaining a stable financial system depend on fundamental problems of information and incentives in financial intermediation.** 
> It is argued that financial regulatory reforms can be reliably effective only when their basic principles are understood by informed citizens, and that Admati and Hellwig's book is a major contribution toward this goal, as** it clearly lays out the essential case for requiring banks to have more equity**.
> The core messgage in this book is that bank should be required to have more equity.

Two effects of equity:
	- increases bank's ability to abosrb risk
	- reduces the incentive to take excessive risk (moral hazard)
